Try out your mouse accuracy and set your highscores in two different modes requiring both precision and agility.

Timed Mode - Click and hold to fill circles and score as many points within 30 seconds.

Accuracy Mode - Make sure not to miss any targets! Beware though, the more targets you hit, the less time you have to aim.
